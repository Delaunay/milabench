# 1. Problem
This task benchmarks recommendation with implicit feedback on the [MovieLens 20 Million (ml-20m) dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/) with a [Neural Collaborative Filtering](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3052569) model.
The model trains on binary information about whether or not a user interacted with a specific item.

### Data preprocessing

1. Unzip
2. Remove users with less than 20 reviews
3. Create training and test data separation described below

### Training and test data separation
Positive training examples are all but the last item each user rated.
Negative training examples are randomly selected from the unrated items for each user.

The last item each user rated is used as a positive example in the test set.
A fixed set of 999 unrated items are also selected to calculate hit rate at 10 for predicting the test item.

### Training data order
Data is traversed randomly with 4 negative examples selected on average for every positive example.

# 5. Quality
### Quality metric
Hit rate at 10 (HR@10) with 999 negative items.

### Quality target
HR@10: 0.635

### Evaluation frequency
After every epoch through the training data.

### Evaluation thoroughness

Every users last item rated, i.e. all held out positive examples.
